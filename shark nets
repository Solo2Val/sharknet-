<p>Traditional shark nets in places like South Africa and Australia have long been criticized for not only their actual shark protection, but also for the amount of other Marine life that environmentalists have attacked. Not until 1993 did that change.</p>

<strong>Are they protecting people?</strong>
<p>No. There is no science showing that the nets make our oceans any safer for beach-goers. In fact a 2009 government report stated that ‘the annual rate of attack was the same both before and after meshing commenced’. While the number of shark fatalities has decreased since the nets were put in the water, this is due to improved medical assistance and not to the nets.</p>
<strong>how do the shark nets work?</strong>
<p>The nets are NOT a barricade, and don’t prevent sharks from getting near the beach. They are simply in place to entangle and kill animals that are passing by. They are 150m wide, and 6m tall and usually set in about 10m of water – allowing sharks to swim over and around. In NSW they are only in the water for 8 months of the year, and only 14 days in each month – so a lot of the time they’re not even in place.</p>

<strong>Are they harming wildlife and ecosystems? </strong>
<p>Yes. Over 15,000 animals have been killed by these nets in NSW – this includes about 100 species such as endangered turtles, dolphins, dugongs, rays, seabirds, harmless sharks and rays. The nets have even killed orcas, little penguins and people – that’s right, shark nets have killed 2 people. Last year a baby humpback drowned in the nets a few beaches from where I live, while its mum watched on. Just to clarify, these deaths are not a trade-off for the protection of people, but are unnecessary deaths in an out-dated system that doesn’t protect anyone.</p>
